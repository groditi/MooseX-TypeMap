 - Fix a bug where entry matching was broken due to a side-effect of
   MooseX::Types::TypeDecorator by eliminating the decorator at BUILDARGS time
 - Because TypeMaps and Types are immutable, cache matching entries
 - Eliminate reader methods in favor of 'elements' methods that return lists
   instead of references. This breaks API compatibility with 0.001000. Effects
   should be minimal, as there was no known legitimate use case for using any
   of the readers from a library or application using Moosex::TypeMap
 - The 'entries' attribute was renamed 'type_entries'. Using the 'entries' key
   in the constructor has been deprecated although support for it will remain
   for at least 6 months.
 - A new method 'clone_with_additional_entries' has been introduced to
   facilitate the cloning of a type map.
